#  Personalized Social Media with Natural Language Feed Customization  

##  Project Overview  
This project aims to build a **social media platform** with a unique feature:  
- Users can **describe in natural language** what kind of feed they want.  
- The system uses **LLMs + optimized search indexing and querying** to generate a **dynamic, personalized feed** that adapts to the user’s request.  
- This moves beyond static algorithms or generic personalization, giving users **direct control** over how their content is curated.

##  Original Project Plan  

The project was designed to include the following phases:  

### **Phase 1 – Core Social Media Functionality**  
- User onboarding and authentication.  
- Basic profile setup and management.  
- Post creation and interactions (likes, comments, media upload).  

### **Phase 2 – Baseline Feed Framework**  
- Implement a simple feed (e.g., chronological or popularity-based).  
- Build indexing and querying mechanisms for content retrieval.  

### **Phase 3 – Natural Language Feed Customization**  
- Allow users to type in what kind of feed they want (e.g., “more fitness content,” “fewer political posts”).  
- LLM interprets the request → generates a query strategy → retrieves relevant posts.  
- Feed updates dynamically based on user instructions.  

### **Phase 4 – Advanced Personalization**  
- Continuous learning from user preferences and activity.  
- Support **multi-turn instructions** (refining the feed iteratively).  
- Balance personalization with diversity and discovery.  

### **Phase 5 – Scaling & Deployment**  
- Deploy the application on scalable infrastructure.  
- Optimize feed generation performance.  
- Add moderation, safety, and content filtering mechanisms.

##  Progress So Far  

###  Implemented Features  
A **basic social media application** has been built as the foundation for testing the main feature. Current capabilities:  

-  **User Onboarding & Profiles**  
  - Registration, login, and profile management.  
  - **Email verification** for secure onboarding.  

-  **Posts Service**  
  - Users can create and share posts.  
  - Support for **media uploads** (images, videos).  

-  **Engagement Features**  
  - Likes and comments system.  
  - Interactive content sharing and feedback loop.  

This foundation is **scaled enough for testing** the upcoming **natural language feed customization feature**.

##  Summary  

The project has already delivered the **core social media foundation** (onboarding, posts, likes, comments, and media support).  

The next step is to implement the **main differentiator**:  
- Users can **type in natural language what kind of feed they want**, and the platform will generate a **customized, dynamic feed** accordingly.
